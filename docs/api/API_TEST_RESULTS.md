## 2. Postman MCP Collection Inspection & Execution

### Workspace & Collection Metadata
- **Workspace Name**: `JAGADEESH SAKHAMURI's Workspace`
- **Workspace ID**: `e2b1ba19-064e-4021-839c-35294e960cf9`
- **Collection Name**: `CONNECT2CODE - All 32 Platform APIs`
- **Collection ID**: `41b6471c-396a-41f1-949d-f66ccc83d8e7`
- **Collection UID**: `58775230-41b6471c-396a-41f1-949d-f66ccc83d8e7`

### Critical Collection Discovery
Despite being titled *"CONNECT2CODE - All 32 Platform APIs"*, the Postman collection contains only **2 requests**:
1. `POST /auth/login` (named `"1. Authentication"`, ID: `58775230-85cf2599-b130-4c1f-ad5c-ddeaae17f18a`)
2. `POST /signUp` (named `"User Sign Up"`, ID: `58775230-9b21e4f1-9339-e473-7a3e-5fcb0f177eee`)

**Evidence Label Distinction**: Only these 2 requests are labeled `POSTMAN_EXECUTED`. The remaining 35 platform APIs referenced in application code and architecture documentation are missing from the collection and are labeled `DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`.

## 3. Workflow Verification: Code Execution & Judge0

### 3.1 Normal User Run (`POST /runCode`) — VERIFIED (FUNCTIONAL PASS)
- **Scenario Tested**: Authenticated regular user submits Java solution for Question 1 (`Find the Largest Element`).
- **Endpoint**: `POST /runCode`
- **Payload Sent**:
  ```json
  {
    "questionId": 1,
    "languageId": 5,
    "sourceCode": "public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"50\"); } }"
  }
  ```
- **Observed HTTP Status**: `200 OK`
- **Latency**: `7,642 ms` (includes Judge0 remote compile and batch sandbox execution)
- **Response Received**:
  ```json
  {
    "totalTestCases": 4,
    "passedTestCases": 1,
    "failedTestCases": 3,
    "testCases": [
      {
        "testCaseId": 1,
        "testCaseType": "Visible Sample Test Case",
        "status": "Passed",
        "input": "5\n10 20 30 40 50",
        "expectedOutput": "50",
        "actualOutput": "50\n"
      },
      {
        "testCaseId": 103,
        "testCaseType": "Visible Sample Test Case",
        "status": "Failed",
        "input": "5\n1 2 3 4 5",
        "expectedOutput": "5",
        "actualOutput": "50\n"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Statuses**:
  - `Functional Status`: **`PASS`**
  - `Auth Verification Status`: **`VERIFIED`** (`USER_OR_ADMIN`)
  - `Evidence Method`: **`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`**
- **Finding**: Normal user code execution against sample test cases is fully operational on the remote backend and Judge0 cluster.

---

### 3.2 Admin Test Code (`POST /admin/testCode`) — VERIFIED (FUNCTIONAL PASS)
- **Scenario Tested**: Authenticated admin tests code execution on Question 1.
- **Endpoint**: `POST /admin/testCode`
- **Anonymous Probe**: `401 Unauthorized` (latency 80ms)
- **USER Probe**: `401 Unauthorized` (latency 289ms — strictly forbidden)
- **ADMIN Probe**: `200 OK` (latency 7,974ms)
- **Statuses**:
  - `Functional Status`: **`PASS`**
  - `Auth Verification Status`: **`VERIFIED`** (`ADMIN_ONLY`)
  - `Evidence Method`: **`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`**
- **Finding**: Admin test runner enforces strict `ADMIN_ONLY` role segregation.

---

### 3.3 Normal User Submit (`POST /submitCode`) — OBSERVED BACKEND DEFECT (FUNCTIONAL BLOCKED)
- **Scenario Tested**: Regular user submits full solution for grading.
- **Endpoint**: `POST /submitCode`
- **Observed HTTP Status**: `500 Internal Server Error`
- **Latency**: `1,664 ms`
- **Backend Error Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 500,
    "message": "Code Submission Failed",
    "data": null,
    "errors": [
      "Cannot invoke \"com.connect2code.codingPlatform.common.entity.ReferenceLibrary.getRefName()\" because the return value of \"com.connect2code.codingPlatform.question.entity.TestCase.getType()\" is null"
    ],
    "timestamp": "2026-10-09T10:16:58.850960772"
  }
  ```
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The submission evaluation pipeline fetches all test cases (hidden + visible) for Question 1. Certain test cases in the backend database have a `null` foreign key for `type_id`, causing a `NullPointerException` inside Spring Boot when calling `testCase.getType().getRefName()`.
- **Statuses**:
  - `Functional Status`: **`BLOCKED`** (Observed backend failure pending root-cause confirmation)
  - `Auth Verification Status`: **`INCONCLUSIVE`** (Reaches submission service for authenticated users, but halted before role boundaries can be conclusively confirmed)
  - `Evidence Method`: **`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`**
- **Important Distinction**: This 500 application exception is an observed failure and must not be classified as a functional PASS.

---

### 3.4 Admin Submit Code (`POST /admin/submitCode`) — VERIFIED ROLE / FUNCTIONAL BLOCKED
- **Scenario Tested**: Admin executes full submission validation.
- **Anonymous Probe**: `401 Unauthorized`
- **USER Probe**: `401 Unauthorized` (Regular user forbidden)
- **ADMIN Probe**: `500 Internal Server Error` (Reaches backend evaluation logic and triggers the identical `TestCase.getType()` NPE).
- **Statuses**:
  - `Functional Status`: **`BLOCKED`** (Observed backend failure pending root-cause confirmation)
  - `Auth Verification Status`: **`VERIFIED`** (`ADMIN_ONLY` — regular user is rejected, admin reaches execution logic)
  - `Evidence Method`: **`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`**
- **Finding**: Access control is correctly configured for `ADMIN_ONLY`, but execution encounters the same database entity defect.

## 4. Architectural Findings & Discrepancies

### Finding 1: Language Table ID vs Reference ID Mismatch
- **Description**: The database stores language records with table primary keys `1` (Java), `2` (Python), `3` (C++), `4` (JavaScript). However, the Spring Boot code execution controllers require the **`ReferenceLibrary` ID** (`5` for Java, `6` for Python, `7` for C++, `8` for JavaScript).
- **Observed Evidence**: Calling `POST /runCode` with `"languageId": 1` fails with:
  `"Language not found for reference ID: 1"`
- **Frontend Mitigation**: `src/services/executionService.ts` contains `resolveLanguageReferenceId()` which translates table IDs 1–4 to reference IDs 5–8 before issuing execution requests.

---

### Finding 2: Slug vs Numeric Path Variable Route Matching
- **Description**: Spring Boot controller endpoints such as `GET /question/{id}` and `GET /company/{id}` declare numeric path variables (`@PathVariable Long id`).
- **Observed Evidence**: Requesting `/question/two-sum` fails Spring MVC pattern matching and triggers Spring Security's 401 fallback filter (`FUNCTIONAL_STATUS: FAIL`). Requesting `/question/1` succeeds with 200 OK (`FUNCTIONAL_STATUS: PASS`).
- **Frontend Mitigation**: The frontend routes resolve question and company slugs to numeric database IDs before executing detail requests.

---

### Finding 3: Unmapped Frontend Endpoints & Spring Security Fallback
The following endpoints defined in `src/core/api/endpoints.ts` do not exist as mapped controller methods on the remote backend and return 401:
1. `GET /company/{id}/problems` — Frontend uses `POST /questions` with `{ companies: [companyId] }` instead.
2. `POST /question/{id}/submit` — Deprecated legacy route.
3. `GET /user/profile` & `PUT /user/profile` — User profile details are sourced from `/auth/login` and stored client-side.
4. `GET /referenceLibrary` — Base lookup is unmapped; callers use `/referenceLibrary/refGroupCode/{groupCode}`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Spring Security 401 Nuance**: In this Spring Security configuration, any URL that does not match an explicit `@RequestMapping` or `@GetMapping` controller method triggers the fallback security filter, which returns `401 Unauthorized` instead of `404 Not Found`. Therefore, a 401 response alone does not conclusively prove an endpoint is unmapped or deprecated without route confirmation. These endpoints are accordingly categorized as `AUTH_VERIFICATION_STATUS: INCONCLUSIVE`.

---

### Finding 4: Undocumented Cloud Bookmark Endpoints
- **Description**: The frontend currently implements user bookmarks locally using `localStorage` (`myjo_bookmarks` in `bookmarkSlice.ts`).
- **Audit Discovery**: Live probing proved that the backend **already implements** owner-scoped bookmark REST endpoints:
  - `POST /users/{userId}/questions/{questionId}/bookmark` (200 OK for owner, `FUNCTIONAL_STATUS: PASS`)
  - `GET /users/{userId}/questions/bookmarks` (200 OK for owner, `FUNCTIONAL_STATUS: PASS`)
  - `DELETE /users/{userId}/questions/{questionId}/bookmark` (200 OK for owner, `FUNCTIONAL_STATUS: PASS`)
- **Opportunity**: Future frontend development can migrate bookmark persistence from local storage to these verified cloud endpoints.

## 5. Summary of Audit Limitations

1. **Postman MCP Collection Scope**: The connected Postman workspace collection only contains 2 of the 32 platform APIs. The Postman MCP server toolset does not provide an ad-hoc single-request HTTP execution runner for endpoints absent from collections; therefore, collection-level verification was limited to those 2 endpoints (`POSTMAN_EXECUTED`), with all other endpoints verified via direct, reproducible HTTP probes (`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`).
2. **Backend Source Code Visibility**: The backend Java repository is hosted remotely on Render. Controller definitions and security filters were deduced from observed HTTP status codes, error payloads, stack traces, and frontend integration contracts.
