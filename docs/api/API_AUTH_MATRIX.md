# Connect-2-Code — API Authentication & Authorization Matrix

This document provides the definitive, evidence-based authorization matrix for all APIs in the **Connect-2-Code** platform.

Every classification is based on actual, live HTTP probes executed with Anonymous credentials, authenticated regular `USER` Bearer tokens, and authenticated `ADMIN` Bearer tokens.

---

## 1. Classification & Status Definitions

### Access Classifications
| Classification | Meaning | Evidence Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`PUBLIC`** | Endpoint allows requests without an `Authorization` header. | Anonymous request succeeds with HTTP 200 or 201 (or reaches controller validation). |
| **`USER_OR_ADMIN`** | Both authenticated regular users (`USER`) and administrators (`ADMIN`) have permission. | Anonymous returns 401/403; both USER and ADMIN tokens return 200 OK. |
| **`USER_ONLY`** | Scoped specifically to regular users (e.g., owner-scoped user data). | Regular user token returns 200 OK; Admin or cross-user token receives authorization rejection. |
| **`ADMIN_ONLY`** | Privileged endpoint restricted to users with the `ADMIN` role. | Anonymous returns 401; USER token returns 401/403; ADMIN token returns 200 OK. |
| **`AUTHENTICATED_ROLE_UNSPECIFIED`** | Endpoint requires authentication, but role boundaries cannot be conclusively separated due to payload validation or backend exception. | Anonymous returns 401; authenticated requests pass security filter but error inside controller logic. |
| **`UNKNOWN`** | Route is unmapped, deprecated, or contradictory. | Route returns 401 across all credential states due to Spring Security catch-all filter. |

### Evidence Methods
- **`POSTMAN_EXECUTED`**: Execution result directly confirmed by the Postman MCP collection runner (`runCollection`).
- **`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`**: Execution result obtained via reproducible direct HTTP probe using fresh tokens.
- **`SOURCE_VERIFIED`**: Verified from frontend source code, routing constants, or backend service mappings.
- **`NOT_VERIFIED`**: Evidence is insufficient to verify behavior.

### Functional & Auth Verification Statuses
- **Functional Status**:
  - `PASS`: Endpoint functioned as expected according to contract.
  - `FAIL`: Route contract failure (e.g., path variable type mismatch on text slugs).
  - `BLOCKED`: Request reached backend service but halted due to an observed backend defect.
  - `INCONCLUSIVE`: Payload constraint check triggered before business logic could be evaluated.
  - `NOT_TESTED`: Endpoint not tested functionally (e.g., unmapped base path or deprecated route).
- **Auth Verification Status**:
  - `VERIFIED`: Access control boundaries conclusively determined across Anonymous, USER, and ADMIN.
  - `INCONCLUSIVE`: Route is caught by fallback security filter (401) or execution halts before role boundaries can be separated.
  - `NOT_TESTED`: Authentication not evaluated.

## 3. Key Observations & Security Takeaways

1. **Strict Distinction Between Postman MCP and Direct Probes**:
   Only 2 requests (`POST /signUp` and `POST /auth/login`) are present in the target Postman collection and were executed through the Postman MCP runner (`POSTMAN_EXECUTED`). The remaining 35 endpoints were probed via direct HTTP/fetch (`DIRECT_HTTP_PROBE`).
2. **Spring Boot Route Fallback to 401**:
   In this Spring Security configuration, any URL that does not match an explicit `@RequestMapping` or `@GetMapping` controller method triggers the fallback security filter, which returns `401 Unauthorized` instead of `404 Not Found`. A 401 response alone does not conclusively prove an endpoint is unmapped or deprecated without route confirmation.
3. **Observed Backend Defect on Submission Workflows**:
   Both `POST /submitCode` and `POST /admin/submitCode` reach the backend execution pipeline but fail with HTTP 500 (`NullPointerException` on `TestCase.getType().getRefName()`). These endpoints are categorized as `FUNCTIONAL_STATUS: BLOCKED` pending backend bug resolution.
